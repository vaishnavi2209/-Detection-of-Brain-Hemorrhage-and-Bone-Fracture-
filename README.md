# -Project Intro -
“Detection of Brain Hemorrhage and Bone Fracture
Through Computed Tomography Analysis Predicting
Diagnostic Procedures”

# Modules Description - 
* Image feature extraction - MATLAB was used for feature extraction in which dilation, erosion, Kmeans Clustering and
Histogram were plotted, based on their entropy, contrast, homogeneity, sum mean, variance,
maximum probability and the correlation  Here, we have tried to extract the
features of image using different functions of MATLAB.

* CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING: The data classification is performed by using Scikit-Learn library of python and the method
opted was supervised machine learning by logistic regression.
The classification model provides the systematic graph plot of the number of people having
hemorrhages which shows that more than two thousand people were having hemorrhages . It also
compares the people having both bone fracture as well as Brain hemorrhage. The classification
model includes the systematic graph plot of the data provided which completes the objective of
our project. In our project classification has its vital role which is because it provides us the data
of the patients who are suffering so that they can be provided with the accurate assistance.


# Tools, Technologies, and Platform used:- 
 *MATLAB
 *GOOGLE COLABS 
 *PYTHON LIBRARIES FOR CLASSIFICATION

# -Number of people in the project
 There were 8 team members working on this project.The responsiblities were equaly divided amoung us all and we all were compatible with eachother .Everyone did there best in there domain.

# Personal contribution and your role in the project:
I contributed in th CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING .
In our project we have various fields included in the data which are used specially for diagnosis
of the brain hemorrhage &amp; Bone fracture, which was the objective of our project. The data
classification is performed by using Scikit-Learn library of python and the method opted was
supervised machine learning. In this we have already used these parameters for predicting the
condition of human brain or bone by image featuring, but the data extracted from the image
featuring required the classification to give a systematic and graphical representation of all the
diagnostic outcomes, and for that logistic regression was being preferred. Moreover, by using
various libraries we have plotted the detectable plots and also checked that the data is free from
all the null values by data wrangling so that we can generate classification report on the well
generated dataset.
The project was based on medical applications, but I got to work in my domain, and also learnt
how the things are worked in other departments as well.
